# Face-Recognition-System-using-Eignen-Values



### Dependencies

- Python 3.4
- OpenCV
- Numpy

### How to Run?

There are two ways to run the program:

- Recognize faces for all test images

```shell
python main.py
```

- Recognizes face for a specified image

```
python main.py <path_to_image>
```



### Output Format

- When we recognize faces for all test images, the output is a table in which the first column specifies the expected output, the second column specifies the actual output and the third column wheter the recognition was correct or not. 

- When we recognize face in a specified image . The output ranges from s1 till s40.

  For example, If the output is s4 then that means that the test image is recognized to be the person whose images are in folder s4.
